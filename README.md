# Simple General Number App

This is a general number app which will do the following
1. Take the user's name
2. Take the user's age
3. Take the user's 3 favorite numbers
4. Subtract the user's age from the sum of the user's 3 favorite numbers and provide feedback.
	* User's age is greater than the sum of the user's 3 favorite numbers
	* User's age is less than the sum of the user's 3 favorite numbers

## Run app.rb to run the app

End results come from *post '/numbers'* calling *function.rb*
