Hi there, what is your name?

<form action='name' method='post'>
	<input type='text' name='user_name' autofocus='autofocus'> 
	<input type='submit'>
</form>

<!-- How forms work: A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server. 
The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters or selects.
The server processes the information using a programming language. It may also store the information in a database.
The server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information received. -->

<!-- Form controls live inside a <form> element. This element should always carray the action attribute.
Along with the action attribute you'll usually see both method and id attributes too. -->

<!-- Every <form> element requires an action attribute. It's value is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the information in the form when it is submitted. -->

<!-- Forms can be sent using one of two methods: get or post:
With the get method, the values from the form are added to the end of the URL specified in the action attribute. The get method is ideal for:
	-Short forms (such as search boxes)
	-When you are just retrieving data from the web server (not sending)
With the post method the values are sent in what are known as HTTP headers. As a rule of thumb you should use the post method if your form:
	-Allows users to upload a file
	-Is very long
	-Contains sensative data i.e. passwords
	-Adds information to, or deletes information from, a database
If the method attribute is not used, the form data will be sent using the get method by default. -->

<!-- The <input> element is used to create several different form controls. The value of the type attribute determines what kind of input they will be creating. -->

<!-- When the type attribute has a value of text, it creates a single line text input.  -->

<!-- When users enter information into a form, the server needs to know which form control each piece of data was entered into. (For example, in a login form, the server needs to know what has been entered as the username and what has been given as the password.) Therefore, each form control requires a name attribute. The value of this attribute identifies the form control and is sent along with the information they enter to the server. -->
